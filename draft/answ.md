What are the "Four Freedoms" defined by the Free Software Foundation?
R= According to Html files and "Repaso" files, the "Four Freedoms" are:
-Freedom to run the program for any purpose
-Freedom to study how the program works
-Freedom to redistribute copies
-Freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others

How does the GNU Manifesto justify the ethical importance of free software?
R= They answer that question saying that sharing whatever that u can share is a great way to do Internet a better place for everyone,
thousands of creators had their ideas from piracy,
kids around the world are being inspired by torrents or codes from github to develop apps and ideas
and future generations will get inspired and will get fun from apps that they can't get in a "legal" way.
In a formal way: According to Richard Stallman, withholding software would be against the ethical principle of helping others, 
as sharing software enhances community collaboration and access to knowledge.

What is the difference between "open source" and "free software"?
R=
-Open source: It's a way to develop a high-quality code, app or web for everyone, that happens thanks to all the people who decide to bring a hand 
and sharing their knowledge to develop a better code.

-Free software: It means to bring a code and the users can run, study, modify, and share  new codes or softwares.


 Theme: AI and Copyright
Write a critical reflection in answ.md (inside the draft/ folder) addressing:

The ethical dilemma presented in the article.
How the issue relates to software libre principles (e.g., freedom, transparency, user rights).
Your stance on the issue, supported by philosophical reasoning.

-So I read a text about The AI and Copyright, The ethical dilemma was about the copyright inside the training of a AI without permission from the original creators
Anna's Archive, a shadow library hosting over 140 million copyrighted texts, has been providing high-speed access to major AI companies, especially those based in China,
to use these materials for training their language models. we can see how thats a bad use of copyright, obviously you can not eat air and you need to make money but that
explain the following point (freedom, transparency and user rights).
First of all we can say that user rights are okay but when ur decisions affects all the users, their expressions, projects etc.
that emphasizes the importance of respecting individual rights and treating others as ends in themselves, not merely as means to an end.
And according to the "Gold rule" that's a bad use of copyright and
transparency.
To sum up I'm going to say my stance on the issue: for me that's a bad and egoist way to keep an idea that can help
all the world and society evolutions, that's ethically unacceptable in every way and that show us again how long can be the human's egoism and the "real" world.
